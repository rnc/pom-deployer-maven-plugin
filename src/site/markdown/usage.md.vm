# Introduction

This plugin is useful in the scenario where you have a generated XML file (typically a pom file) that you wish to deploy to a different `groupID:artifactID` than the main artifact. This use-case is typically used in conjunction with the [POM Manipulation Extension][] when it generates up a BOM for a project build. This BOM needs to be installed/deployed to a predictable location and not attached e.g. via the build-helper-plugin.

# The add-pom mojo

This mojo takes the specified XML file, together with the `groupID` and `artifactId`. It will **both** install and deploy the file. In order to support deployment, similar to the standard maven-deploy-plugin it also supports the concept of altDeploymentRepositories.

The main options are:

  * errorOnMissing: By default this plugin _will_ throw an error if the target file is missing.
  * skip: By setting `add-pom.skip` the plugin can be skipped entirely.
